You are building a ticket booking system for a cinema. 
The system needs to determine the ticket price based on the movie type, age, and seat selection. 
Implement the following rules using if, else if, else statements, comparison operators, and logical operators:

- For regular movies:
  - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $8.
  - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $12.
  - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $10.

- For 3D movies:
  - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $10.
  - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $15.
  - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $12.

- For IMAX movies:
  - For children (age < 12), the ticket price is $12.
  - For adults (age >= 12 and age < 65), the ticket price is $18.
  - For seniors (age >= 65), the ticket price is $15.

- For VIP seats, add $5 to the ticket price.

Implement the ticket booking system by taking inputs for movie type 
("regular", "3D", or "IMAX"), age, and seat selection, and outputting the final ticket price based on the rules above.





You are building a subscription plan calculator for a fitness app. 
The calculator needs to determine the monthly subscription cost based on the user's selected plan and additional options. 
Implement the following rules using switch cases, comparison operators, and logical operators:

- The available plans are: "Basic", "Standard", and "Premium".
- The base monthly costs for each plan are: Basic - $10, Standard - $15, and Premium - $20.
- Users can select additional options: "Personal Trainer" and "Meal Plan".
- The Personal Trainer option costs $5 per month, and the Meal Plan option costs $8 per month.
- If the user selects both options, an additional discount of $3 is applied.

Implement the subscription plan calculator by taking inputs for the selected plan and the options, 
and outputting the final monthly subscription cost based on the rules above.
